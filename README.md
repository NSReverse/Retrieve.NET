# Retrieve.NET
This is a simple Visual C# application that I ported from my Retrieve-android project where a user can download YouTube videos offline. Uses the .NET 4.5.2 framework.

### About this project
The goal of this project is for me to practice making ports from my Android apps to Windows desktop. This application works with native Visual C# and .NET 4.5.2 to download and play YouTube videos on Windows desktop machines.
